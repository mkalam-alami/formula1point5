## Formula 1.5 Infographics generator

This is an early test to generate infographics for [/r/Formula1Point5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Formula1Point5/).
If there is interest this page could someday be made more powerful, eventually supporting all sorts of infographics.

### For developers

To get a local version working, simply clone the repo and open `index.html` locally. This tool was developed with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

Contributions are welcome.
